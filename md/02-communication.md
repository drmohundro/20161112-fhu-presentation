## College Communication

* What percentage of your assignments are group projects?
* How often do you email or respond to email? <!-- .element class="fragment" -->
* Do you ever have to explain how something works? <!-- .element class="fragment" -->
* Does anyone ever ask YOU how something should be solved? <!-- .element class="fragment" -->
* Do you ever have to communicate with people remotely? <!-- .element class="fragment" -->

Note:
* 90+% of my professional projects have been with others...
  * 100% of them have been worked on by others
* Depends on the job, but you might get overwhelmed by email
  * There are entire books on how to deal with it
  * "Inbox Zero"
* Particularly explaining to non-technical people
  * Not necessarily explaining to your grandmother, but certainly not someone who understands how a computer works
  * They're probably your user. That or they're the ones telling you what project to build.
* Maybe not at first, but expect to solve problems for yourself
  * I'm not talking about figuring out algorithms, I'm talking about system structure, database schema, possibly even recommendations for a platform
  * I probably didn't have to do this myself until ~2 years after college, but your experiences may vary
* This is relatively new in the industry (or at least is becoming more widespread)
  * For my first job, none of the developers were remote
  * Second job, only one was remote
  * Today, most of my team is located in the same location, but 100% of our clients have been remote
    * The majority have been in other states (if not time zones even)
