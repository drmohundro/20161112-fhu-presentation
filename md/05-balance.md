# Balance

## Wait... balance what?

* Writing the best code versus staying on budget
* Fixing all the bugs versus shipping on time

<..>

## Maintainability

* You are writing code for your future self
  * Document well
  * Well-named variables, methods, tables, columns, etc.
  * Takes practice to perfect!
* Even the best developers are going to look at code they wrote a year ago and be like... <!-- .element class="fragment" -->

## Technical Debt

* Debt is "something, typically money, that is owed or due."
* So... what would technical debt be?
* Is debt good or bad?
* Balance with maintainability
  * Usually you can't (and shouldn't) rewrite everything
  * Remember the amount of history in some of these projects?

Note:
* Debt can be a strategic decision
  * Can't buy a house or car without debt right? Can't go to college without debt?
  * Why take on debt? Because you're getting something of greater value or of longer lasting value
  * For projects, you need to ship NOW so you don't necessarily do things the best way

## YAGNI!

Note:
* Learn to be realistic... mostly learn from experience

## Work-Life Balance

Note:
* Can be difficult to balance with all of the learning
* Even with all of that communication, programming is still mostly a sedentary job
* So get up and get outside some!
